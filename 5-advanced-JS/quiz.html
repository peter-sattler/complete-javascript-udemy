        <h1>Section 5: Coding Challenge 7</h1>
        <p>--- Let's build a fun quiz game in the console! ---</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should             include:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The question itself</li>
                <li>The answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)</li>
                <li>The correct answer (I would use a number for this)</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Create a couple of questions using the constructor</li>
            <li>Store them all inside an array</li>
            <li>Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each     question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this 
                task).</li>
            <li>Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the       number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on #4.</li>
            <li>Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or 
                not (Hint: write another method for this).</li>
            <li>Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make 
                sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).</li>
            <p>--- Expert level ---</p>
            <li>After you display the result, display the next random question, so that the game never 
                ends (Hint: write a function for this and call it right after displaying the result)</li>
            <li>BE CAREFUL: After #8, the game literally never ends. So include the option to quit the game 
                if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer. In this case, DON'T call the function from #8.</li>
            <li>Track the user's score to make the game more fun! So each time an answer is correct, 
                add 1 point to the score (Hint: I'm going to use the power of closures for this, but you don't have to, just do this with the tools you feel more comfortable at this point).</li>
            <li>Display the score in the console. Use yet another method for this.</li>
        </ol>
