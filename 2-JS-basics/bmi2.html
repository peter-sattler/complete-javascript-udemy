        <h1>Section 2: Coding Challenge 4</h1>
    </body>
    <p>
        Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height</li>
        <li>Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.</li>
        <li>In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
