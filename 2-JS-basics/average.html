        <h1>Section 2: Coding Challenge 2</h1>
        <p>
        John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the average score for each team</li>
            <li>Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner     to the console. Also include the average score in the output.</li>
            <li>Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into         account there might be a draw (the same average score)</li>
            <li>EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points.       Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the &&       operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the           solution, it's no problem :)</li>
            <li>Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind       there might be draws.</li>
        </ol>
