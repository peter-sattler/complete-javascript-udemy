        <h1>Section 2: Coding Challenge 1</h1>
        <p>
            Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body 
            Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height)
            <br>
            (mass in kg and height in meters)
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Store Mark and John's mass and height in variables</li>
            <li>Calculate both of their BMIs</li>
            <li>Create a boolean variable containing information
                about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John</li>
            <li>Print a string to the console containing the
                variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI
                higher than John's? true").</li>
        </ol>
