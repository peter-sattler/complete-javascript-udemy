        <h1>Section 7: Coding Challenge 8</h1>
        <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of    two town elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Parks</li>
            <li>Streets</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks    and streets have a name and a build year.</p>
        <p>At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)</li>
            <li>Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li>
            <li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
            <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
            <li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is     unknown, the default is normal</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All the report data should be printed to the console.</p>
        <p>HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default            parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.</p>
